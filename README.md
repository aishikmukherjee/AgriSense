# AgriSense
AgriSense is a cloud-enabled, database-driven system that simulates the ingestion, processing, and analysis of IoT sensor data (temperature, humidity, soil moisture, crop health, etc.) from multiple farms. 
Built as part of Sprint 1 in the Cognizant Azure Path Training (Techademy), the project uses SQL and Python to simulate ETL pipelines and manage normalized schemas for both structured and unstructured data.

## Project Overview

Modern agriculture relies on IoT sensors to monitor real-time farm conditions. AgriSense provides a foundational data platform that supports:

- Simulated ETL workflows
- Structured and unstructured data handling
- Normalized relational schema design
- Command-line interface (CLI) for database operations
- Designed for future Azure cloud integration

## Features

- **Sensor Data Simulation**: Ingests sample data for temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and crop health.
- **ETL Pipeline Simulation**: Python scripts for data extraction, transformation, and loading into a SQL database.
- **Normalized Schema**: Efficient relational schema for querying and analysis.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Allows users to interact with the data system without needing a UI.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites (Minimum / Recomended Requirements)
- Laptop or PC :
  - 4GB RAM
  - i5 or equivalent processor
  - Windows OS (8 and above)
- Stable internet connection (Above 50 Mbps)
- Python 3.8 or later (Pycharm IDE recomended)
- MySQL Server
- Recommended external Python packages:
  - prettytable

### How to use the project

- Clone the full repository into your local Pycharm IDE
- Install external packages
- Run the main.py script for the first time
- For the second and after runs comment the insertion function
- Then use the menu of the CLI to navigate and interact with the database
- To uplaod and handel unstructured JSON data for weather alerts simply run the alert_jason.py file (give the source jason file name inside in the appropriate place by reading comments inside)
